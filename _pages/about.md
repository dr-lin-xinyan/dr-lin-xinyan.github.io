I am an environmental social scientist with 12+ years of experience in marine conservation strategy and program management. With a PhD in Marine Science and Conservation from Duke University (2024), I combine academic rigor with practical experience in designing and implementing effective conservation initiatives globally.

My core strengths include:

**Strategy Development & Implementation:** Designing comprehensive conservation programs that align stakeholder interests with measurable conservation outcomes.

**Grantmaking Portfolio Management:** Overseeing complex grantmaking programs with rigorous financial oversight and performance tracking.

**Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning (MEL):** Creating robust frameworks for major organizations including such as Oak Foundation and WWF that drive adaptive management and evidence-based decision-making.

**Partnership Building:** Facilitating collaboration among diverse stakeholders, from government agencies to NGOs and research institutions, to create coordinated approaches to ocean conservation challenges.

At Duke, I refined my analytical skills under Prof. Xavier Basurto and Prof. Lisa Campbell, focusing on marine fisheries and biodiversity governance. My research employs innovative methodologies to evaluate intervention effectiveness in global ocean policy contexts.

As Founding Director of the China Marine Funders Alliance, I coordinated a network of 30+ foundations, tripling investments in ocean conservation (2017-2020). At Oak Foundation, I managed $20+ million in grant portfolios across four continents, developing strategic priorities and ensuring effective implementation.

Based in Switzerland, I am seeking opportunities in conservation program management beginning June/July 2025, with particular interest in roles that leverage my expertise in strategic conservation grantmaking and program implementation.
