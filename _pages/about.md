I am Dr. Xinyan Lin 林 欣砚, a conservation social scientist with a PhD in Marine Science and Conservation from Duke University. My research and professional work focuses on the intersection of social equity, monitoring and evaluation frameworks, and strategic impact assessment in marine conservation. With over 10 years of specialized expertise, I help bridge the gap between conservation science, policy implementation, and measurable outcomes.

Research Interests
Ocean equity and social dimensions of global ocean governance
Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) frameworks for conservation initiatives
Small-scale fisheries management and commons governance in China
Philanthropic funding flows and their impact on marine conservation
Cross-cultural approaches to environmental grantmaking

Academic Background
I completed my PhD at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment (2018-2024), where my dissertation "Mobilizing Ocean Equity: Global and Chinese Assemblages, Onto-Epistemological Possibilities, and Gongyi Agency" examined the complex interplay between equity considerations and conservation practices. Prior to Duke, I earned a Master in International Affairs from the Graduate Institute Geneva (2013-2015) and a Bachelor of Business Administration from Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University in Japan (2008-2012).

Professional Experience
My career spans both academic research and practical implementation. As an Associate at Oak Foundation Marine Programme, I managed grant portfolios totaling over $20 million across four continents, focusing on marine plastic pollution, IUU fishing, and small-scale fisheries. I also served as the Founding Director of the China Marine Funders Alliance (2017-2020), where I established a network of over 30 Chinese and international grantmaking foundations, tripling annual investments in China's coastal and ocean conservation.

Current Research and Focus
My research examines how funding flows impact conservation outcomes, with particular attention to social equity dimensions. My publications investigate equity mobilization at global ocean governance forums, the role of philanthropic foundations in China's marine conservation, and the evolving dynamics of small-scale fishery commons in China.

I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can apply my expertise in MEL frameworks and social dimensions of conservation to help organizations maximize their environmental impact while ensuring social equity considerations are integrated throughout their work.
